      <h3 id ="me">The MPT is a mean-variance theory, and it compares the expected (mean) 
        return of a portfolio with the variance of the same portfolio. 
        The image shows expected return on the vertical axis, and the horizontal axis 
        should be labeled variance instead of standard deviation (volatility). 
        Variance is the square of volatility. The return - 
        variance space is sometimes called the space of 'expected return vs risk'.
        Despite its theoretical importance, critics of MPT question whether it is an ideal investment tool, because its model of financial markets does not match the real world in many ways.[9][1]

<p>The risk, return, and correlation measures used by MPT are based on expected values,
 which means that they are statistical statements about the future (the expected value
  of returns is explicit in the above equations, and implicit in the definitions of 
  variance and covariance). Such measures often cannot capture the true statistical
   features of the risk and return which often follow highly skewed distributions 
   (e.g. the log-normal distribution) and can give rise to, besides reduced volatility,
    also inflated growth of return.[10] In practice, investors must substitute predictions
     based on historical measurements of asset return and volatility for these values in 
     the equations. Very often such expected values fail to take account of new circumstances
      that did not exist when the historical data were generated.[11]</p>

More fundamentally, investors are stuck with estimating key parameters from
 past market data because MPT attempts to model risk in terms of the likelihood of losses, 
 but says nothing about why those losses might occur. The risk measurements 
 used are probabilistic in nature, not structural. This is a major difference
  as compared to many engineering approaches to risk management.

<p>Options theory and MPT have at least one important conceptual 
difference from the probabilistic risk assessment done by nuclear power [plants].
 A PRA is what economists would call a structural model. The components of a system and 
 their relationships are modeled in Monte Carlo simulations. If valve X fails,
  it causes a loss of back pressure on pump Y, causing a drop in flow to vessel Z, and so on.</p>

But in the Black–Scholes equation and MPT,
 there is no attempt to explain an underlying structure to price changes. 
 Various outcomes are simply given probabilities. And, unlike the PRA, 
 if there is no history of a particular system-level event like a liquidity crisis,
  there is no way to compute the odds of it. If nuclear engineers ran risk management 
  this way, they would never be able to compute the odds of a meltdown at a particular plant until several similar events occurred in the same reactor design.

— Douglas W. Hubbard, The Failure of Risk Management,
 p. 67, John Wiley & Sons, 2009. ISBN 978-0-470-38795-5
Mathematical risk measurements are also useful only 
to the degree that they reflect investors'
 true concerns—there is no point minimizing a variable
  that nobody cares about in practice. In particular,
   variance is a symmetric measure that counts abnormally
    high returns as just as risky as abnormally low returns. 
    The psychological phenomenon of loss aversion is the idea
     that investors are more concerned about losses than gains,
      meaning that our intuitive concept of risk is fundamentally
       asymmetric in nature. There many other risk measures 
       (like coherent risk measures) might better reflect investors' true preferences.

Modern portfolio theory has also been criticized because 
it assumes that returns follow a Gaussian distribution.
 Already in the 1960s, Benoit Mandelbrot and Eugene Fama 
 showed the inadequacy of this assumption and proposed the use
  of more general stable distributions instead. Stefan Mittnik and 
  Svetlozar Rachev presented strategies for deriving optimal portfolios in such settings.[12][13][14]
   More recently, Nassim Nicholas Taleb has also criticized modern portfolio theory on this ground, writing:
        <p> Every possible combination of risky assets,
          can be plotted in this risk-expected return space, and
           the collection of all such possible portfolios defines a region in this space. 
           The left boundary of this region is parabolic,[3] and the upper part of the parabolic
            boundary is the efficient frontier in the absence of a risk-free asset
             (sometimes called "the Markowitz bullet"). Combinations along this upper
              edge represent portfolios (including no holdings of the risk-free asset)
               for which there is lowest risk for a given level of expected return. </p>
               Equivalently, a portfolio lying on the efficient frontier represents 
               the combination offering the best possible expected return for given risk level.
